# Overall
The overall goal of this fork is creating a version of proto23 that requires more active play, the difficulty should be higher, but items also stronger, capable of greatly improving a player's strength. 

## Equipment
Equipment strengths/weaknesses should diverge more and more as the game goes on, up to a maximum. These are required as enemies get more specialized, or have glaring weaknesses. 

## Skills
Skills should provide overall bonuses, and should be the main way of gaining stats early on. However, as they advance, they should provide unique bonuses, such as certain resistances, xp, and even more unique stuff like regeneration (perhaps through titles?). After about level 10-11, weapons should give very specialized but strong bonuses, as players are less likely to gain multiple of those unless they specifically grind for them, to reward them.

## Consumables.

Elemental resistances, over-time regeneration, and strong but short effects should be more common. Very powerful items could share a cooldown, or have drawbacks like reducing their opposite element's resistance.

## Areas

The main areas should be element-focused, containing a central story, element and specific effects and problems (frostbite, heat, tanks, DOT, etc.) that require lots of preparation. The central story should offer quests that provide great quests in beating said problems, and the final boss. The boss offers items that permanently boosts statistics, powerful gear, and an initially useless 'gem' that upon optaining the entire set can be crafted on a very powerfull booster, which is vital in defeating the final boss (as it offers a bonus to a very hard to get, unique element)
