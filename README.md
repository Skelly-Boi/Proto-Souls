## Description

This mod is intended as a harder difficulty for proto23, but also includes overall changes to the structure of gameplay and areas present in game.

Planned:
-Stronger items, consumables and equips
-More dangerous effects
-Cyclical/time-locked areas, which contain special items and opportunities
-Bosses that provide powerfull boons, but are extremely difficult and require the use of consumables and specific weapon/equipment types.
-A central story-line, and many branch-quests for your grinding needs.
-Much grinding, althought as you progress gaining xp and stats becomes easier and easier, so you are incentivised to use everything available to progress.
